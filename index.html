         <p>Cristina García’s 2003 novel <i>Monkey Hunting</i> spans four generations of migration between China, Cuba, the US, and Vietnam. The story follows Chen Pan and his descendants across oceans and continents, through tragedy and triumph. García's work engages a rhetoric of death and rebirth to tell stories of departure, journey, and the repositioning of identity. In this essay, I examine what her novel can tell us about the immigrant’s process of living within and becoming part of a new community. I read the experience of migration as a complex physical and a spiritual passage. More specifically, I am interested in how García’s depiction of migration employs language of death and renewal and, furthermore, how this rhetoric corresponds with certain elements and figurations of social rites that center around rebirth.

         <p>In this study, I look at the process of Chen Pan’s transition into Cuban society through ritual elements of migration. His story celebrates his successful establishment in Cuba and his full life. This ending is very different from that of Domingo’s story – the last time we see him in the novel, Domingo is a lost and wandering young man. The second half of my study (not included on this site) explores why, unlike Chen Pan, Domingo Chen is unable to find a new home in a different country. I highlight elements of the ritual process that appear in the migrations of both Chens to identify where their resembling journeys diverge. This examination leads to my assertion that the novel presents a sharp social critique of corruption, forced migration, and its affect on the environment.</p>

         <p>Cristina García tells the stories of three generations that are defined by exile. Her text presents complex identity negotiations provoked by migration, displacement and the search for <a href="#home" class="external">home</a>. Chen Pan, one of <i>Monkey Hunting</i>'s main characters, leaves China in 1857 when he is twenty-one years old. He travels to Cuba to work as <a href="#an-indentured-servant" class="internal">an indentured servant</a> in the sugar cane fields. The novel begins with his departure for the island and ends with the moments preceding his death sixty years later. The majority of the text in-between tells of his voyage and servitude, his successful establishment in Havana, and his life as an older man.</p>

         <p>Chen Pan’s life path structures the 251-page novel while the rest of the text interweaves the stories of his granddaughter, Chen Fang and great-grandson, Domingo Chen. Episodes from Chen Fang’s experiences in 20th century China and Domingo Chen’s exile to New York City in the 1960s and subsequent deployment in the Vietnam War make up the rest of the fifteen chapters, which divide into three sections to represent the loosely paralleling life stages of these main characters. This essay compares Chen Pan’s migration with that of Domingo Chen, who leaves Cuba for New York City in the 1960s as an exile. Soon after, Domingo Chen deploys with US forces to fight in the Vietnam War.</p>

      <div class="sidebar" id="home">
         <p>Lee proposes a reimagining of “home” in her discussion of Monkey Hunting, highlighting the paradoxical nature of the idea and redefining it through diaspora as a continual “homing” (127-8). She follows Ian Chambers’ idea of the mobile home that is neither fixed in place or allocated to a structure, which may also remind us of Gloria Anzaldúa’s likening of her own identity to a turtle who carries her home on her back (Chambers 4; Anzaldúa, Borderlands 21). For the purposes of this essay, home describes a spiritual recognition of self that is linked to place. My concept of finding home goes hand in hand with “planting roots,” both metaphorically and, as we will see, literally.</p>

      <div class="sidebar" id="an-indentured-servant">
         <p>Marta J. Lysik identifies the novel as “a transnational neo-slave narrative insofar as it follows multiple trajectories and brings to the foreground various forms of slavery: chattel system in Cuba, forced marriages, foot binding and cross-dressing in pre-Cultural Revolution China, and prostitution during the Vietnam war [sic]” (276).</p>

         <p>1860 saw the end of the second Opium War (1856-60; also known as the “Arrow War”), which weakened the Qing Dynasty and granted trading rights within China to foreigners. Amoy was one of five treaty ports established after the first Opium War (1839-42).</p>
         <p>Ylce Irizarry writes, “Because she was two years old when they left, she has no memories of Cuba; this lack has shaped her academic interests and pervades her writing, where memory is a constant motif” (175).</p>

   <section id=:"Author">
		<p>Before entering the discussion of the text, here is a brief introduction of the author and her work. Cristina García (Havana, 1958) was raised in New York City after leaving Cuba in 1960 after the Cuban Revolution. She holds an MA in international relations from John Hopkins University and worked to become an accomplished journalist before dedicating herself to fiction. Her many awards include the Northern California Book Award (2008), the Frontizera Award from the Border Book Festival (2008), a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship (2004), two Cintas Fellowships (1997 and 1992), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1995), the Whiting Writer's Award (1996), a Hodder Fellowship (1992-3), and writing/teaching residences at numerous universities and colleges. Her work includes poetry, young adult fiction, theater, and non-fiction, but she is perhaps best known for her six novels which include <i>Dreaming in Cuban</i>, a National Book Award Finalist in 1992, <i>The Agüero Sisters</i> (1997), and the focus of this study, <i>Monkey Hunting</i>.</p>

         <p><i>Monkey Hunting</i> engages a rhetoric of death and rebirth to tell stories of departure, journey, and the repositioning of identity. In this essay, I examine what her novel can tell us about the immigrant’s process of living within and becoming part of a new community. With the following study, I hope to illuminate this cultural transition by focusing my reading on how the movement of people can be seen as a complex physical and a spiritual passage. More specifically, I am interested in how García’s depiction of migration employs language of death and renewal and, furthermore, how this rhetoric corresponds with certain elements and figurations of social rites that center around rebirth. The stories of Chen Pan and Domingo provide the textual foundation for this section as their experiences mirror each other in various ways throughout the novel. Ultimately, the tale of Chen Pan celebrates his successful establishment in Cuba and his full life. This essay is the first half of a chapter that looks at the process of Chen Pan’s transition into Cuban society through ritual elements of migration. His story ends very differently from Domingo’s narrative, which leaves Domingo as a lost and wandering young man. The second part of the chapter (not included on this site) explores why Domingo Chen is unable to re-root himself in a new home. In it, I highlight elements of the ritual process that appear as part of both Chens' migrations. I examine where their resembling journeys diverge to propose what I read as a strong social critique presented in the novel.</p>

      <div class="sidebar" id="monkey_hunting">
         <p>As Jade Tsui-yu Lee points out, the title alludes to the trickster figure of Chinese legend, a monkey named Sun Wukong who appears in the 16th century novel Journey to the West (127). Begoña Toral Alemán concisely summarizes WuKong’s story and notes its influence on García’s novel: “A rasgos generales, este libro [. . .] recoge las aventuras del monje Hsuan Chwang en su largo peregrinaje a la India en busca de escrituras budistas; una odisea en la que le acompañan cuatro discípulos que se enfrentan a toda clase de peligros, incluyendo demonios y monstruos” (95).</p>
         <p>Xiomara Campilongo examines how <i>Monkey Hunting</i> works to counter Orientalist tropes and stereotypes while also noting that Chen Pan’s process of transculturation is far from easy. Rather, it is “painful, one with gains and loses” (122).</p>
         <p>These similarities include: their stories begin when they are roughly the same age (about nineteen to twenty years old), neither set of their parents has a harmonious marriage, both of their fathers die when they are young, they have strained relationships with their mothers who remain in their homelands and with whom they eventually cut ties, both go to carnivals before they leave their homelands, both journey overseas, their lovers are women born in the foreign lands where they find themselves, both of their lovers have experienced suffering greater than their own, and both fight to survive in the jungle.</p>

      <h2>I. Reading Migration through Ritual Rebirth</h2>

      <h3>A. Rites of Passage and Displacement</h3>
      <p>When Chen Pen and Domingo Chen leave their homelands, they enter an in-between state of displacement. Detached from the “before,” the migrant undergoes an intermediate phase before he is able to establish himself “after” as a member of the new place’s social fabric. The process of migrating and adapting to a new country is individual, complicated, and nuanced, but in García’s text I observe an overall pattern that I believe can deepen our understanding of how peoples and cultures connect.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="In_the_novel">
      <p>In the novel, the in-between stage of migration only concludes when the immigrant finds closure with the past and emerges as a member of the new community. For example, upon leaving his village Chen Pan begins transitioning from the life he has known in China to the one that awaits him in Cuba. His transition is not an immediate change, but rather a gradual process that is not complete until he becomes a member of Havana society. This period of change extends across years of his life, including his time as an indentured servant and his stay in the jungle. Although he may be physically located in Cuba, he is not “re-rooted” there until he himself feels a part of the island and recognizes it as home.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Both_Chen">
      <p>Both Chen Pan and Domingo Chen caught within liminal stages that continue for long periods of time and stretch across vast distances as they struggle to pass from one social group to another. They experience a social transition that recalls ethnographer Arnold van Gennep’s study of social processes in Les rites de passage (1909).</p>
      <p>Van Gennep highlights three phases of a rite of passage: separation/preliminal (séparation), transition/liminal (marge), and incorporation/postliminal (agrégation).</p>
      <li>1. The first stage signals the breaking with or departure from the initial state</li>
      <li>2. The second stage encompasses the transitional phase</li>
      <li>3. The third stage marks full integration into the new social position</li>
   </section>

   <section id="Van_Gennep">
      <p>Van Gennep’s second chapter, “The Territorial Passage,” is particularly interesting when considering the aspects of migration that align rites of passage. He begins with a discussion of historical boundaries between peoples and notes the shift of natural borders to religious divisions and later political ones and the resulting delineation of territory (15-9). In doing so, he posits a direct link between migration (“crossing frontiers”) and social transition, although his research predominantly focuses on ceremonial transitions practiced within a community. He envisions the individual human’s life as filled with a continuous and overlapping series of changes and sees the progression of time as developing through a succession of events (3). Most commonly these life milestones are birth, adolescence, marriage, parenthood, advancement to a higher class, occupational specialization, and death (van Gennep 3). With these ideas, van Gennep provides a foundation in ritual studies that has been greatly built upon, expanded, argued against, and developed.</p>
   </section>

   <div class="sidebar" id="succession">
      <p>Van Gennep conceptualizes life’s transitions as a house with many rooms entered by passing under doorways that represented the thresholds of change. Important theorists include Victor Turner, Ronald L. Grimes, Theodore Jennings, Catherine Bell, Evan Zuesse, Mircea Eliade, Clifford Geertz, and Stanley Tambiah.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="sidebar" id="passage">
      <p>Link to source material Importantly, I do not wish to suggest that the novel portrays migration as strictly adhering to van Gennep’s conception of social ritual. Nor do I want to imply an all-encompassing experience of migration and social transition that might simplify or minimize the importance of the individual experience. Rather, I intend to explore how elements of the ritual process inform the narrative, what they add to the text, and why García’s choice to incorporate this rhetoric to tell stories of migration is relevant for my reading of the novel.</p>
      <p>García’s novel consists of three sections titled “Origins,” “Traveling through the Flesh,” and “Last Rites,” a structure that points to the organization of the text around an outlining of this process (although the characters’ life phases do not necessarily follow the section headings). Later in this essay I elaborate upon reason as to why this alignment does not occur, primarily because throughout the novel, Domingo remains in a liminal phase and does not fully re-enter society. However, the stories of the three main characters (Chen Pan, Chen Fang, and Domingo Chen) do follow an approximately similar structure in that “Origins” tells of leaving their families and the hardships of their early years and “Traveling through the Flesh” includes all three characters finding brief happiness in non-traditional romance which then ends by the conclusion of the section. Only the final days of Chen Pan and Chen Fang appear in “Last Rites.”</p>
   </div>
   </section>

   <section id="origins">
      <h3>B. Chen Pan Separates from his “Origins” (open page of “origins” video)</h3>
      <p>The novel’s first section, “Origins,” highlights Chen Pan’s departure from his homeland as a break with the past and the beginning of his transition into a new life. From its start, the story focuses on Chen Pan’s leaving and journey to the Americas, choosing to reveal little about his homeland. Although the novel affords limited retrospective glimpses into Chen Pan’s past that add some depth of character, García lets most of his background remain obscured. In this way, the text purposefully introduces him as a man who is already “in-between” as he has just exited his past life. For the reader, Chen Pan’s identity is immediately tied to his status as a migrant. Aside from a few scattered memories, the novel rather ambiguously relates the short and only episode in which we see Chen Pan in China. Contained entirely within the prologue, all of the text that describes the time pre-departure appears in italics, setting it apart from the novel as a preceding description of “before.” In this section, we find Chen Pan at a circus on the dock of the harbor from which he will depart for Cuba the next morning. Physically located where the land meets the sea, the harbor represents not only the beginning of his overseas journey, but also occupies a place between his inland Chinese village and the island.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="The_liminal">
      <p>The liminal and carnivalesque aspects of the harbor space that surround Chen Pan emphasize his entry into the transition stage. Victor Turner’s work develops van Gennep’s idea of the liminal phase. He underscores the initiate’s sense of disorientation upon leaving the known and understood world (“Ritual Process” 27, 95). In accordance with Turner’s observations, Chen Pan feels lost and dazed at the circus as he floats through a cloud of opium smoke and dancing women. Time slows and space distorts as his environment overwhelms him and he realizes the separation between these new experiences and his life in the village: “How far away [his home] seemed to him now” (4). After the prologue, the first chapter finds Chen Pan aboard the ship, again foregrounding his identity as a migrant. Furthermore, Amoy (Xiamen), China, the city from which Chen Pan’s ship leaves, is the only Chinese city fully named in the entirety of the novel.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="García_cites">
      <p> García cites places and towns in China using only the beginning letter followed by dashes (for example, “K-----” ). In this way, the text denies the reader any fixed geographical point to begin the past, instead asking us to situate Chen Pan’s “origin” at the place and moment of departure. Chen Pan’s past remains a blur of memory about which sparingly little is revealed. Ironically titled “To Paradise,” <i>Monkey Hunting</i>’s first chapter relates Chen Pan’s crossing of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans as one of the hundreds of indentured servants that left China for Cuba as part of <i>la trata amarilla</i>.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="At_sea">
      <p>At sea, the passengers exist between their former lives of home and their hoped-for new beginnings on the island. If we recognize leaving China as a break with the previously known, the departure can be considered as an end or “death” of the former existence in preparation for the beginning of a new life. Viewing migration in this way supports the idea of the journey as a transition phase between two lives, reminding us of van Gennep’s detailing of tribal rituals in which the initiate is considered dead within the intermediary stage and reborn upon emergence from the liminal:</p>
      <blockquote>intermediary stage and reborn upon emergence from the liminal, In some tribes the novice is considered dead, and he remains dead for the duration of his novitiate. It lasts for a fairly long time and consists of a physical and mental weakening which is undoubtedly intended to make him lose all recollection of his childhood existence […] Where the novice is considered dead, he is resurrected and taught how to live, but differently than in childhood. Whatever the variations of detail, a series which conforms to the general pattern of rites of passage can always be discerned. (75)</blockquote>
      <p>When viewing the passage as a spiritual transition, we can see aspects of the migrant’s voyage that both liken it to a type of purgatorial holding stage and continues on the island. They must be endured before achieving a “rebirth.”</p>
   </section>

   <section id="The_prevalence">
      <p>The prevalence of deathly language in the descriptions of the indentured servants’ suffering during the voyage encourages our reading of the scenes as closure of a previous life. Tales of ill-fated trips fill the passengers with fear as they hear of “Death voyages. Devil ships. On one journey, there was nothing to eat on board except rice” (62). Soon, what was once only hearsay becomes the migrants’ reality: nine men die within the first month “not counting those killed in fights or beaten to death by the crew” and one man hangs himself with strips of clothing, the sound of his swaying “like the slow tearing of silk” (13; 15). Importantly, the severity of the conditions described are also historically accurate.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Onboard_the_ship">
      >Onboard the ship, the passengers suffer physically from violence and “every manner of illness” (13). Thirst, starvation, abuse by captain’s guards, threats of mutiny, illness, and conflicts between passengers all contribute to the torturous suffering of the journey: “Chen Pan watched men drink their own urine, lick moisture from the walls of the ship. A few swallowed seawater until their stomachs swelled and they choked in their own filth” (9). Death plagues the ship, a vessel carrying many men who are, in many ways, “as good as dead” as they may not survive whatever awaits them. They must fight to survive the journey’s many obstacles as the sea and the ship become spaces saturated with death. These descriptions underscore the position of the migrant as closer to the departed than to the living. In this way, the text continues to link migration and movement to ritual passages of transitions, emphasizing the journey as part of a crossing from one life into another.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Furthermore">
      <p>Furthermore, the hellish language of death and unrest underscore the journey as liminal. These descriptions follow Turner in that “liminality is frequently likened to death” (“Ritual Process” 95). Aboard the ship, the passengers are miserable and terrified of the unknown. A feeling of looming death overwhelms the migrants as many men die or commit suicide by poison, hanging, or jumping into the sea to end their suffering (14). Rumors of their doomed fate circulate amongst the passengers and heighten their fear “that their ship was headed for the Philippines; that every last man on board would be killed there, heart scooped from his chest; that they’d be sold to cannibals who savored yellow flesh” (16). The ship entraps them in “cramped, stinking squalor” and is “outfitted like a prison, with irons and grates”, encapsulating them in a vessel of pain, confusion, and violence (11; 8). The sea as a deadly space of crossing surrounds them in vast emptiness. This description of the journey as filled with death and suffering enhances passage’s portrayal as part of Chen Pan’s liminal stage.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="The_physical">
      <p>The physical and spiritual suffering and the atmosphere of death that imbues the journey presents one of the novel’s central themes: that migration is the movement of body and soul. Van Gennep writes that the departure from and the entry into a different space requires “physically and magico-religiously” passing through an intermediate phase, emphasizing the crossing as affecting both the body and the spirit (18). Likewise, García’s characters experience migration as a physical relocation of body and a spiritual journey of self. This idea is reinforced by the immediate problem that dying at sea presents for the migrants who have yet to settle in a new home: the absence of land denies the dead man a physical resting place and a proper burial, without which the soul is unable to detach from the body and the spirit cannot to return to China. Those who die during the transition period leave the earth without a located home. To discuss the conflict between the dead body’s physical location and the spirits’ desire to return to China, characters repeatedly refer to those who have died as ghosts. When Lin Chin dies of a brutal beating:</p>
   </section>

   <section id="His_body" <blockquote>his body was dumped at sea. It was said that Lin Chin didn’t sink at first but floated alongside the ship for hours, his eyes fixed on the sky. Chen Pan wondered if the dead man’s ghost would find its way back to China. Or would it wander forever among the unvirtuous and the depraved? (12)
      </blockquote>
   </section>

   <section id="The_man_does">
      <p>The man does not sink to the sea’s bottom peacefully, but disturbingly follows the ship, his dead body mirroring the path of the migrants and refusing to fully surrender to the ocean depths. The migrating body carries a displaced soul and in this way, a placeless death yields an aimless spirit. Without a home, the man’s ghost may wander forever, eternally a migrant, perpetually caught in a state of incomplete transition. Similarly, “The night the Wong brothers died, a squall engulfed the sea. The storm ripped off a mast and tossed two officers overboard. The men feared that the brothers’ ghosts had cursed the ship, that they were causing the thunder and the lightning, the wind from eight directions, the waves as high as the Buddha’s temples” (15). Their bodies left unsettled and their spirits without home, the Wong brothers inspire fear and are imagined as vengeful ghosts. They are caught in a space of crossing between lands and abandoned without the necessary burial rites. Their unfortunate end again shows that dying at sea prohibits the deceased from attaining spiritual rest.</p>
   </section>

   <section id=Harbor>
      <p>The novel develops the idea of migration as a spiritual and physical transition by including comparable beliefs of other cultural populations in Cuba, specifically those of the African slaves, and in doing so, García posits that these elements of migration can be transcultural. The novel follows Chen Pan and his descendants; therefore Chinese tradition is weighted most heavily in the text, but García also mentions practices of the communities encountered by Chen Pan (and, to a lesser extent, Domingo Chen in Vietnam). While working with the African slaves in the sugarcane fields, Chen Pan witnesses their death rituals and beliefs surrounding burial. Rita is a slave whom both Chen Pan and the slave master fancy. The passage describing the death of her lover, Narciso, underscores displacement as informed by both the body and the soul’s need to re-root themselves. When the master impregnates Rita and Narciso is executed, “Nobody was allowed to bury him. Instead he was fed to the bloodhounds before the entire barracón, piece by bloody piece. Poor Mandingo spirit, the slaves chanted, lost and forever wandering” (35). The slaves’ powerlessness to perform the proper burial rites denies Narciso’s spirit a return to the homeland. Enslaved on the plantations, the Africans are trapped in a liminal state. The body needs to be ceremonially reunited with the earth in order to free the spirit from its wandering. If the burial is prohibited, as in the case of Narciso, the spirit is forever lost, reminding us of the wandering ghosts of the Chinese men who die at sea.</p>
   </section>

   <div class="sidebar" id="exited">
      <p>Moiles offers another reason behind the lack of information we are presented about Chen Pan’s life in China, writing “the thin description implies the futility of attempting to recapture the wholeness of the past” (179).</p>
      <p>From 1848-74, a total of 124,813 indentured laborers were brought to Cuba from China and contracted to work for eight years (Okihiro 43). For further historical information, see Antonio Chuffat Latour, Evelyn Hu-Dehart, Arnold J. Meagher, Yrmina Eng Menéndez, Raquel Puig, Don E. Walicek, Lisa Yun, and Ana Zapata-Calle.</p>
      <p>Zapata-Calle notes, “Los puertos principales fueron Amoy, Macao, Swatow, Hong Kong, y Wampoa” (171).</p>
      <p>Hometowns are noted in this way for all the Chinese immigrants in the novel.</p>
      <p>In this chapter, I do not employ the term “coolie” (except in direct citations from the work of others) to avoid the historically racist connotations of the word. However, it is used in much of the current literature. Yun and Laremont define coolie: “[T]he term of coolie generalizes Asian laborers in a wide spectrum of ethnic histories, material conditions, and political context. The terms “coolie” or “indentured laborer” are generic assignations that classify the economic utility of coolies […]. Coolie labor was utilized in Cuba, Peru, Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica, Panama, Mexico, Brazil, and Costa Rica, among other places in the Americas” to replace the dwindling labor force resulting from the abolition of slave trade (Yun and Laremont 101). And Zapata-Calle further describes this history: “La mayoría de estos trabajadores eran hombres que llegaron a Cuba con un contrato de trabajo que les garantizaba teóricamente su libertad tras el cumplimiento del mismo. La llamada “trata amarilla” fue emprendida por los británicos tras el tratado firmado con China al finalizar la segunda Guerra del Opio (1840-1842), mediante el cual los ingleses contaban con toda la disponibilidad comercial en territorio chino. Esta trata duró desde 1847 hasta 1874” (Zapata-Calle 171).</p>
      <p>In her interview with the author, Ylce Irizarry notes that García’s description of Chen Pan’s journey follows the conventions of slave narratives (181). Her horrific descriptions are true to reality as many historians have noted that the transportation of indentured servants to the Americas was equally as terrible and brutal as Atlantic Slave Trade’s Middle Passage (Hu-Dehart; Meagher; Yun and Laremont). See Don E. Walicek for the exact data regarding Chinese leaving China, number of deaths during voyage, and survivors arriving in Cuba from 1847-1870 (300). For instance, in 1857, the year Chen Pan departs for China, 1,575 of the 10,116 Chinese who embarked for Cuba died in the voyage (Walicek 300).</p>
      <p>The likening of the journey between home and a foreign place (specifically China and Cuba) with death is repeated later in the novel when Chen Pan’s wife falls terminally ill, “To him, Lucrecia’s impending death felt like a voyage he was preparing to take to a foreign land—to China, perhaps, where he kept promising they’d go before she died” (167).</p>
      <p>In his introduction to Beginning Ritual Studies, Grimes writes, “Turner rejects aculturalism and atemporalism in method only to rediscover it in liminoid phenomena, which not only are experienced as “moments in and out of time” (1968a, 5) but are cross-cultural and universally human. Liminality is transcultural. […] Despite his recognition of the temporariness of liminality-communitas, he still views this experience as essentially the same in widely differing times and places” (153).</p>

   </section>

   <section id="The_depiction">
      <p>The depiction of the passage from China to Cuba initiates the turmoil that the Chinese will endure as indentured servants on the island. Spectral descriptions loom in the recounting of this time on the plantation, “Chen Pan looked out the window at the passing sugarcane fields, at their endless, swaying green. How inviting they looked from this distance. Who could fathom the mountain of corpses that had made these fields possible?” (190). Many Chinese and African workers commit suicide and death and pain permeate the landscape to such an extent that a century later Domingo remembers his father telling him, “To work the sugarcane fields […] was to go wooing mournful ghosts. The chain gangs of runaway souls, ankles ulcerated and iron-eaten and wrapped in rags. Or the luckier suicide ghosts who’d killed themselves dressed in their Sunday best” (48-9). The spirits of those who suffered and died in the fields linger to haunt the land with memories. During Chen Pan’s time, the indentured servants and slaves are forced to work, robbed of their freedom and, in many ways, their lives.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Suffering_surrounds">
      <p>Suffering surrounds Chen Pan so much that he begins to think of himself as a man who is less than alive. We see this in Chen Pan’s failed attempts at writing letters home to China to assure his aunt, wife, or brother that he is not dead. He never finishes his letters, “Better to let everyone think that brigands had robbed and killed him, that vultures had come and plucked out his eyes. He knew that his wife would burn incense in his name, urging his ghost home” (32). Chen Pan’s status as an indentured servant holds him in a liminal position. In the preceding text, we see that he still recognizes China as the closest place he has to a home, but he is unwilling to establish any communication with his family there. It also reveals that if his wife received news of his death, she would hope for his ghost’s return as Chen Pan does not yet belong anywhere else. This in-between position of his soul reminds us of Narciso’s wandering spirit. Furthermore, in his reluctance to prove that he is alive, Chen Pan chooses to allow his family to assume that he is dead. Leaving his family to consider him deceased in China reinforces Chen Pan’s severance with his former life even as he is still yet to find a new one in Cuba.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="As_an_indentured">
      <p>As an indentured servant, Chen Pan remains in a transition phase because he is unable to establish a life in Cuban society as a free man. He exists between what he has left behind in China and what he strives to achieve in Cuba. During this time, Chen Pan works as a servant in hopes of crossing out of this state, however, for the years he is unable to do so he is caught in this “in-between” position where he works without any rights or voice. Restricted from acting as a full member of society, Chen Pan is confined to the margins and to a liminal existence, an idea Turner develops from van Gennep’s outlining of ritual phases.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Turner_utilizes">
      <p>Turner utilizes the term “liminal” to expand upon the understanding of the intermediary phase of social rites, describing this position as “being-on-a-threshold […] betwixt-and-between the normal, day-to-day cultural and social states and processes…” (“Frame, Flow” 465). He extends the idea of the liminal threshold to more than a transitional moment by emphasizing the space it encompasses as “between.” His writings transfer the focus from the liminal as a crossing to the idea that the place of transition itself can occupy a space suspended between two central power structures. In this way, liminal identity and marginalized social position are connected to the ritual process. Chen Pan finds himself in this position upon arriving to the island where he feels lost and unsure of who he is. Unsure of how to help himself or secure a future, he wonders, “Who was he now without his country?” and feels his dreams have been lost in vain (21; 30).</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Turner_also">
      <p>Turner also underscores ambiguity as a necessary condition of the liminal state “since this condition and these persons elude or slip through the network of classifications that normally locate states and positions in cultural space” (“Ritual Process” 95). “Vanishing Smoke,” the title of the chapter describing Chen Pan’s time cutting sugarcane and his escape to the forest, lends a spectral aspect to the text. It also suggests the liminal quality of Chen Pan’s state and refers to the nickname of the legendary first Chinese cimarrón in whose footsteps Chen Pan follows, likening the two men who disappear, like smoke, from their plantations.</p>
   </section>

   <div class="sidebar" id="plantation">
      <p>Urbistondo describes indentured servitude, “The Chinese indentured system in Cuba, or La trata amarilla (the yellow trade), lasted about twenty-seven years. It first began and stopped in 1847, then started up again in 1853 and continued without interruption until 1874. The Chinese government abolished this treaty with Spain three years later. The indenture system executed term contracts usually lasting between seven to eight years. These contracts were legally binding and recorded in court dockets. Once the term was up, the laborer was supposedly set free and given a sum of money to begin their free life. However, while an indentured laborer, the individual worked under a patron who was legally able to sell indentured contracts as well as coerce indentured laborers” (37).</p>
      <p>Many critics point out the similar experiences of indentured servants and slaves, “Once landed, they were offered for sale as though they were slaves” (Richardson 75). As Zapata-Calle writes, “Estos hombres sufrieron explotación y racismo tanto en su estado de trabajadores en los cultivos de caña de azúcar, como al acabar sus contratos, ya que si bien algunos fueron capaces de conseguir su estatuto de libertad y desarrollar negocios comerciales fuera de las plantaciones, otros fueron forzados a firmar de nuevo sus contratos (172). Arnold J. Meagher notes the consequences of indentured servitude, “Some have estimated that 70 or 75 percent of the Chinese laborers in Cuba died before the completion of their eight years of indenture” and “Many contemporary observers and commentators unequivocally condemned the system of Chinese indenture as a ‘new slavery.’ That was the considered judgment of John V. Crawford, the British consul general at Habana, of the Cuba Commission, or Richard Gibbs, the United States minister at Lima, of the Peruvian historian Félix Cipriano C. Zegarra, of the Brazilian statesman Joaquín Nabuco, and of Joseph Beaumont, the chief justice of British Guiana from 1863 to 1868” (Meagher 219, 296).</p>
      <p>Most of the Chinese laborers were sent to work on plantations in the Mantanzas region (Yun and Laremont 108).</p>
      <p>Toni Morrison’s 1987 novel Beloved while Lysik identifies additional intertextual references drawn from Beloved and various other slave narratives, including Frederick Douglass’ autobiographical writings, Gayl Jones’ Corregidora (1975), and Alice Walker’s The Color Purple (1982) (Moiles 180; Lysik 283-296). Lee also recognizes influences from Maxine Hong Kingston’s 1990 novel Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book (129).</p>
      <p>This idea of displaced ghosts trying to find home repeats later when Domingo recalls the stories of Vietnamese girls who go to the US, “Stories drifted back to Vietnam of former bar girls waking up in Georgia, bleaching their hair, wearing blue jeans and cowboy hats, renaming themselves Delilah. [. . .] Saddest of all were the suicides—the poisonings, the slit wrists. Anything to set their souls free to fly home” (208-209).</p>
      <p>Ghostly language describes additional characters who are trapped and suffering. After Rita’s lover is murdered and Chen Pan falls in love with her, the other slaves talk of Rita as if she were already dead, “The other Chinese said Chen Pan was crazy, in love with a dead girl. The Africans also believed this, but they were too tender-mouthed to say it aloud” (35).</p>

      <h3>D. Chen Pan Exits the Liminal and Re-Roots Himself</h3>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pan_flees">
      <p>Chen Pan flees indentured servitude into the Cuban jungle, a space that facilitates his establishment in Havana. The year he spends in the jungle represents the culmination of his transition phase. The forest exists outside of the rules and norms of society that bind Chen Pan to indentured servitude and force him to occupy a marginalized position. Within what he deems the “semi-civilized world,” van Gennep notes that “deserts, marshes, and most frequently virgin forests” are often zones of neutrality that physically mark a liminal zone (18). Between the rural sugar cane plantations and the city, the social structures of the outside disappear within the forest. Wandering in this jungle, Chen Pan still embodies the role of a migrant seeking refuge, “Chen Pan walked and walked until his feet bled, following streams and the slow rotation of stars” (40). Chen Pan looks to nature in an attempt to orient himself in the woods, reminding us of Turner’s assertion that the wilderness frequently acts as a liminal space and that the initiate often experiences disorientation within the transition stage (“Ritual Process” 95).The jungle provides a liminal space for the final steps of Chen Pan’s social transition.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pans_year">
      <p>Chen Pan’s year in the jungle also recalls van Gennep’s studies of a Congolese tribe’s rite of passage for adolescents into adulthood, “The order of the rites is as follows: the novice is separated from his previous environment, in relation to which he is dead, in order to be incorporated into his new one. He is taken into the forest, where he is subjected to seclusion, lustration, flagellation, and intoxication with palm wine, resulting in anesthesia” (81). Chen Pan’s experience loosely follows this structure—he is assumed dead by the outside world and he enters a forest where he faces a series of trials. Within the jungle, he seems to lose some of his body’s material presence, “His own shadow grew unfamiliar to him, thin and strangely angled” (40). Chen Pan’s contorted shadow suggests a diminished and withering substance, reiterating his status as less than fully alive.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pans_time">
      <p>Chen Pan’s time in the forest is dark and ominous, much like the scenes aboard the ship and in the fields. However, the language describing the physical crossing of the ocean emphasizes death as corporal. As Chen Pan approaches the threshold of his new life in the jungle, the symbols and atmosphere of death that surround him seem less physically threatening and more mystically and spiritually charged. Omens of death pervade the forest as bloodhounds pursue Chen Pan with “devil ghosts” in their throats, the wind carries the sounds of their howling, and owls shriek at him in Chinese (39). The moonless silence augments the feeling of impending danger. Later the moon appears and “The forest turned cemetery-quiet. Moonlight unsettled the trees” and Chen Pan remembers that “The Africans had spoken of the restless demons that roamed the island’s woods, disguised in animal furs” (41; 39). Lydia Cabrera reminds us of the <i>monte</i>’s spiritual significance in Afro-Cuban syncretic religions, describing the sacred mountain’s forests as a supernatural space governed by its own law, a dangerous “dominio natural de los espíritus” (18). The haunting language culminates on the <i>monte</i>, but appears through the various stages of Chen Pan’s prolonged transition phase (the voyage, the years in the fields, the time in the jungle). The similar frightful elements and the rhetoric of death unify these years as a liminal period in Chen Pan’s life. Ultimately the exiting of this forest space corresponds with the conclusion of Chen Pan’s transition phase. As this time draws to a close, the spiritual elements of the liminal intensify to reflect Chen Pan’s need to face his internal conflicts.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="To_leave_the">
      <p>To leave the jungle and enter his new life, Chen Pan not only needs to survive the spooky wilderness but he must also turn inwards and confront his past. The year in the forest acts as the last phase of the holding period when Chen Pan overcomes the final spiritual and physical trials. These internal battles appear in the form of a brown owl. He believes the bird to be a manifestation of his mother’s disturbed spirit, come to haunt him in retribution for abandoning her and failing to fulfill his filial duties of sending money or producing a grandson (39). Chen Pan faces his mother’s disappointment by enduring the owl’s presence and working to appease her spirit. He remembers, “In China it was said that owl chicks ate their mothers as soon as they were big enough to fly” (40). Like the owlets devour the owl upon being able to leave the nest and begin their own lives, Chen Pan needs to shed his mother’s ghost before he can leave the forest, perhaps reminding us of van Gennep’s observation that birth (in Chen Pan’s case, “rebirth”) necessarily includes a rite of separation from the mother (“Rites of Passage” 50-2). Chen Pan is considering eating the owl when she abruptly disappears. For the time she follows him, Chen Pan withstands her presence. Her disappearance acts as a resolution that represents Chen Pan’s cutting of ties with and completion of his duties to his mother, and in many ways, his past. Significantly, the owl torments Chen Pan for nine months. He sustains the owl’s pestering presence for the same amount of time as the human gestation period, underscoring the bird’s disappearance as the completion of a renewal and “rebirth.”</p>
   </section>

   <section id="In_addition">
      <p>In addition to the emotional trials Chen Pan overcomes and his survival in the wild, an essential element of his passage into Cuban society is that he physically unites with the environment. Chen Pan leaves the forest ready to fully recognize Havana as home only after a union with the nature of the island takes place. First, he climbs to the top of a ceiba tree where he “will[s] himself invisible” (39). He tries to disappear altogether, to blend into his surroundings and become part of the habitat around him. The presence of the ceiba is spiritually significant, which García points out by reminding us of its sacred role in African belief systems, “the tree was their mother; her sap, blood; her touch, a tender caress” (38). Identifying the tree as a mother presence further enhances the reading of Chen Pan’s transformation in the jungle as one of rebirth. He sits at the roots of the tree, finds himself among the talismans buried there, and rubs his body with “its sacred earth” (38). In this spiritually-charged place, he unites with the land. Later:</p>
   </section>

   <section id="He_remembered">
      <blockquote>He remembered something his father had told him. It is in death alone that we return home. So Chen Pan arranged a bed of cobwebs and silvery leaves on the bat guano that cushioned the floor of a limestone cave, smeared pollen on his face and hands. He would die there, leave his bones to crumble. He would die there in that nowhere cave, and then his ghost would fly home to China. (41)</blockquote>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pan_prepares">
      <p>Chen Pan prepares himself for the end of his life and buries his body, covering himself with dirt, so much so that his skin becomes “red-brown as the island earth” (41). The ritual aspects of death/rebirth (burial) and joining with the earth conflate in a way that recalls van Gennep’s discussion of Albrecht Dieterich’s writing in <i>Mutter Erde</i> (1905) to identify “some resemblances in the details of certain birth and funeral rites” (52). Van Gennep suggests that some of what Dieterich viewed as rites of incorporation with Mother Earth were actually rites of separation (52). In Chen Pan’s case, the year in the Cuban jungle closes his transitional identity as a migrant, ending the process of separation from his “before” life in China. His burial not only marks an end, but also completes the crossing of a threshold into his new life. In these moments preparing himself for death, he still does not consider Cuba home and assumes his spirit will try to return to its home of “before.” But when Chen Pan awakes the morning following his self-burial, his spirit has not returned to China. Instead, the burial and symbolic death within the liminal jungle completes the transition stage and frees Chen Pan’s spirit from its ties to a former land. He can now find his home in Cuba.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pan_performs">
      <p>Chen Pan performs a final task on his last morning in the jungle. He tells himself that if he kills a <i>jutía</i> (a groundhog-like rodent), he will remain on the island. He does so immediately and with ease, this test proving the competence and skills he has gained on his journey. The trials of the jungle prepare Chen Pan for his new life by helping him let go of his past and adapt to his surroundings. We learn in a subsequent chapter that with the act of killing the <i>jutía</i>, Chen Pan “cut off his queue and stopped dreaming of returning to his village” (62). Previously, Chen Pan felt relieved that his employer didn’t force him to cut off his hair as other landowners did (21). Thus, the disposing of his queue symbolizes the final steps of closing his Chinese life. This marks the end of the liminal stage where “The rites of the threshold are therefore not “union” ceremonies, properly speaking, but rites of preparation for union” (van Gennep 21). Chen Pan realizes that this time has readied him for his new life, thinking to himself, “After two years on the plantation and nearly another battling his mother’s ghost, what else could be as hard?” (62). Ana Zapata-Calle too recognizes the obstacles of the jungle as necessary rituals for Chen Pan’s “rebirth” or what she calls “transformation of identity”:</p>
   </section>

   <section id="El_personaje">
      <blockquote>El personaje practica todos los rituales necesarios para despedirse de ella adecuadamente, para que descanse y lo deje a él vivir en paz en su nueva vida. Simbólicamente, este es el primer paso de la transformación de la identidad de Chen Pan. Su madre patria china ha muerto y Chen Pan reconoce que no amaba a la esposa que dejó sin hijos en China. Ahora, en la nueva tierra, empezará la búsqueda de su nueva patria. Su transformación hacia una nueva realidad transculturada comienza en el monte con el cambio de su color de piel por el sol y la referencia al valor sagrado de la ceiba, en la que confía, por ser el árbol sagrado de sus amigos negros. (175)</blockquote>
   </section>

   <section id="Overcoming">
      <p>Overcoming the external obstacles of the jungle and the internal ghosts of his past signifies Chen Pan’s advancement through the transition phase and, with it, his readiness to fully re-enter the living world and freely establish a new life. Zapata-Calle notes the ending of emotional ties with his family in China and the physical adaptation to the nature of the island as necessary to this process. With these trials completed, Chen Pan leaves the jungle.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="After_the_episode">
      <p>After the episode relating Chen Pan’s success in the jungle, the novel jumps forward seven years to find him achieving remarkable success in Chinatown as a businessman. The narrative underscores that Chen Pan’s fortunate rise in Havana’s Chinatown coincides with his identification of Cuba as home. However, Douglas Davies reminds us of the importance of recognizing </p>
      <blockquote>a distinction […] between status and identity, […] At its simplest, status can be viewed as coming from society, as something which is accorded to an individual either because of their birth-right or else through personal achievement. Identity, by contrast, reflects the more internal process of becoming what one is supposed to be. It often takes time for the internal change to match the externally granted position. (7)</blockquote>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pans_movement">
      <p>Chen Pan’s movement from indentured servitude on the fringes of society to his role as a community leader and business owner in central Havana represents the social and internal processes of reinvention. He accepts a separation from his Chinese life, which allows him to self-identify as Cuban (his later assistance to the soldiers fighting in the Ten Year’s War highlights his loyalty to his island home). Still, his “death” or distance from his past life and embracement of Cubanness does not mean that he forgoes his Chinese heritage. In fact, the novel reveals that he maintains various traditional Chinese practices. Chen Pan takes pride in his home culture while also embracing his identity as Cuban. During the rest of Chen Pan’s long life on the island, he wavers between moments of feeling more attached to his Chinese heritage and more connected to his Caribbean home. In this way, a mix of cultures informs his sense of self, pushing and pulling within him. The process of “rebirth” does not erase or take away what came before but, importantly, it allows Chen Pan to make Cuba his new home and find acceptance there.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="Six_years">
      <p>Six years after his time in the jungle, Chen Pan feels deeply that Havana is his city: “Chen Pan never understood what the sight of Havana, with its seductive curve of the coast, stirred in him; only that from the moment he arrived, he knew it was where he belonged” (62). Those in Havana also come to recognize him as part of the city: “The ginger vendor nodded when he saw Chen Pan. Others did, too. Everyone knew him in Chinatown. His regular customers called him un chino aplatanado, a Chinese transplant. The recent arrivals from China wanted to be like him, rich and unflinching” (62). Chen Pan achieves impressive status in Chinatown. </section>
   <section id="He_belongs"> He belongs to a community in which he is admired as a leader by other Chinese immigrants. Additionally, the use of “aplatanado” in Chen Pan’s nickname signals an identity in Spanish, specifically Caribbean Spanish. He is known beyond Chinatown with a phrase that means “becoming native” in the dominant language on the island, signifying that he has found a place there as Cuban despite encountering many by racial, cultural, and linguistic differences as an immigrant.</p>
   </section>
   </section>

   <section id="Chen_Pans_exit">
      <p>Chen Pan’s exit from the liminal phase is possible only after he overcomes his internal conflicts and physically endures the island’s natural environment. Reading Chen Pan’s transition into Cuban society as a mental and physical process writes the experience of migration as a movement of the body and soul. Earlier in the novel, Chen Pan remembers his father telling him, “If it was true that man had two souls, one of the body and the other ethereal, then they would merge with the earth and the air after death” (10). His father’s words correspond with the beliefs regarding death of the Chinese on the ship and of the African slaves and reinforces the necessity of connecting to the earth in death. His statement again likens burial to Chen Pan covering himself at the foot of the ceiba, the earth allowing for the release of both souls. It highlights the importance of Chen Pan’s transition period as both of the body and of the mind so that he can find himself completely in his new home. The novel presents a migrant who assimilates to Cuban society after he completes a ritual-like transition that occurs during the voyage, on the plantation, and then culminates in the wilderness.</p>
   </section>

   <div class="sidebar" id="transition_stage">
      <p>The initiate often experiences disorientation within the liminal stage as she or he has left the known and understood world to be “ground down to a uniform condition to be fashioned anew and endowed with additional powers to enable them to cope with their new station in life” (Turner “Ritual Processes” 95).</p>
      <p>Ignacio López-Calvo recognizes the bird’s pursuit and the belief that she is a deceased mother’s reincarnation as one of the novel’s various intertextual references to Miguel Barnet’s Biografía de un cimarrón (1968). Others include scenes modeled from Esteban Montejo’s memories, the recreation of “silent suicide,” and the games the slaves play for entertainment (43-44).</p>
      <p>Urbistondo draws from Belinda Edmonson’s discussion of Sigmund Freud to examine Chen Pan’s desire to eat the owl and its relationship to his exiled status: “The thought of consuming the owl symbolizing his mother’s spirit within this exiled space is emblematic of Belinda Edmondson’s discussion of the ‘matria.’ Edmondson states, ‘If exile...is predicated on the banishment of the writer by patriarchal authority, the place ‘he’ is banished from, the native land, the ‘matria,’ is maternalized. Similarly, Freud equated exile from one’s native land with exile from the mother: the nostalgia for the home country is in actuality a nostalgia for the mother’s body’ (146)” (43-4). Urbistondo goes on to suggest that Chen Pen’s failure to consume the owl represents a separation from the motherland, China (44).</p>
      <p>Lydia Cabrera writes, “La ceiba [. . .] es el árbol más característico de la isla y el árbol sagrado por excelencia, al extremo de que cabría preguntarse si es el objeto de un culto independiente—culto a la ceiba, en el que comulgan por igual, con fervor idéntico, negros y blancos—si no supiésemos ya que todos los muertos, los antepasados, los santos africanos de todas las naciones, traídas a Cuba, y los santos católicos, van a ella y la habitan permanentemente. Era también para los chinos que se importaron durante la colonia, y hoy para sus descendientes, &lt;&lt;el trono de Sanfán Kon, el mismo Santa Bárbara en China&gt;&gt;” (149). Therefore Chen Pan’s unification with the ceiba also gestures to the tree’s prominence in Cuban-Chinese syncretic practices.</p>
      <p>“Some of the rites noted by Dieterich do actually pertain to the earth itself, but they are nonetheless rites of separation. Thus the expression kourtrophos should be taken literally; the earth is the home of children before they are born—not symbolically as a mother, but physically, as it is the home of the dead. Therefore, some resemblances in the details of certain birth and funeral rites exist. If a child dies before the rite of his incorporation into the world is performed and is therefore buried rather than cremated, this is done, in my opinion, in order to return him to his place of origin. Dietrich has cited German beliefs (and identical ones exist in Australia and Africa) according to which the souls to be born (taking the word “soul” in its broadest sense) live under the earth or in rocks. Various peoples also believe that the souls live in trees, bushes, flowers, or vegetables, in the forest, and so forth” (van Gennep 52).</p>
      <p>Joseph C. Dorsey asserts that although freed indentured servants were granted “white” status legally, “The legal freedom and honorary white status of the Chinese contract worker theoretically punctuated his social and cultural separation from the black slave, and therein lay the heart of a rather unsurprising contradiction. According to local and transient observers as well as the Chinese themselves, they were not treated as free people at all” (Dorsey 20-1).</p>
      <p>Importantly, the novel also emphasizes luck and a wealthy benefactor as keys to Chen Pan’s success.</p>
      <p>García references Havana’s monument honoring the Chinese who fought in the War of Independence. Erected October 10, 1931 on la Calle Línea in Habana it reads, “No hubo un chino cubano desertor; no hubo un chino cubano traidor” (Siu, “Restaurant” 164, 169). García states, “I […] was surprised to learn that the Chinese participated in various wars for independence. They very quickly took on the nationalist cause and fought as long and hard for Cuban independence as anybody. There were many Chinese war heroes” (Monkey 259-60). Further information regarding Chinese involvement in these wars can be found in Antonio Chuffat Latour and Lisa Yun.</p>

   <h2>II. A Social Message Within <i>Monkey Hunting</i></h2>
   <section id="social_message">
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>García’s migrants suffer because of human corruption. She writes the destruction of everyday people at the hands of Caribbean slave owners and Chinese warlords, by the Communist Party of Cuba and US occupation forces on the island, and because of the senseless violence of soldiers and generals on both sides of the war in Southeast Asia. By telling these stories, the novel brings to light the unsettling status quo of historical oppression and “prob[es] and revisit[s] traumatic moments in history, saving them from silence and oblivion” (Lysik 293). While doing so, García’s narrative consistently avoids any outright alignment with a particular political philosophy, preferring to describe the hardship and pain inflicted throughout history by powerful exploitive forces.</p>
      <p>In the second part of this chapter, which will be published at a later date, I compare the narrative strains of ritual process in Chen Pan’s and Domingo Chen’s stories as a base for what I propose is the novel’s critical view of global society: that corrupt power structures that function with a lack of regard for humanity result in the enslavement of populations, the poisoning of the earth, and the ostracizing of complex subaltern identities.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p><i>Monkey Hunting</i> tells the successes and heartbreaks of a family’s continual migration and of a relationship between the earth and its people. Through the language of death and rebirth, we read the experience of migration as a physical and spiritual transition and the break from home as one filled with deathly omens and frightful imagery. Parallels between beginning a new life in a foreign place and crossing a ritual threshold align the stories of Chen Pan and Domingo Chen with elements of social rites. Uprooting one’s existence from a home in hopes of resettling in another place physically moves the body from one location to another, and this rupture with home leads to a displaced state of wandering. For Chen Pan and Domingo Chen, displacement requires a movement of soul, a replanting of roots that necessitates an identification with the new home, a spiritual rebirth, and a connection with the earth. The successful crossing of the transition threshold depends upon many factors, but significantly includes this union with the surrounding environment. Political upheaval, violence, and the power-hungry “progress” of humankind complicates the possibility of this connection as these conflicts pollute nature and make it progressively uninhabitable. In these stories of migration, spiritual language of ritual death and rebirth portray the migrant’s journey as a complex social transition while underscoring both the increasingly negative impact of greed and forced global movement upon the environment and humankind’s dependence upon this threatened earth.</p>
